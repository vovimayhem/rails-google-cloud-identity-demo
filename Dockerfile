# Stage 1: Runtime =============================================================
# The minimal package dependencies required to run the app in the release image:

# Use the official Ruby 3.0.3 Slim Bullseye image as base:
FROM ruby:3.0.3-slim-bullseye AS runtime

# We'll set MALLOC_ARENA_MAX for optimization purposes & prevent memory bloat
# https://www.speedshop.co/2017/12/04/malloc-doubles-ruby-memory.html
ENV MALLOC_ARENA_MAX="2"

# We'll install curl for later dependency package installation steps

# Stage 2: development-base ====================================================
# This stage will contain the minimal dependencies for the rest of the images
# used to build the project:

# Use the "runtime" stage as base:
FROM runtime AS development-base

# Install the app build system dependency packages:
RUN apt-get update \

# ==============================================================================
# Stage 4: Testing =============================================================
# In this stage we'll complete an image with the minimal dependencies required

# specified in the Gemfile:
RUN bundle config unset --local without

# Install the full gem list:

# Stage 7: Asset Precompilation ================================================
# We'll copy the minimal set of files required by rails to precompile the app
# assets:
FROM testing AS asset-precompilation

# Receive the developer username argument again, as ARGS won't persist between
# stages on non-buildkit builds:

# Stage 8: Builder =============================================================
# In this stage we'll add the rest of the code, compile assets, and perform a
# cleanup for the releasable image.

# Use the "testing" stage as base:
FROM testing AS builder

# Receive the developer username argument again, as ARGS won't persist between

# Configure bundler to exclude the gems from the "development" and "test" groups
# from the installed gemset, which should set them out to remove on cleanup:
RUN bundle config set --local without development test

# Cleanup the gems excluded from the current configuration. We'll copy the
# remaining gemset into the deployable image on the next stage:

# Test if the rails app loads:
RUN SECRET_KEY_BASE=10167c7f7654ed02b3557b05b88ece RAILS_ENV=production rails secret > /dev/null

# Stage 9: Release =============================================================
# In this stage, we build the final, releasable, deployable Docker image, which
# should be smaller than the images generated on previous stages:

# Use the "runtime" stage as base:
FROM runtime AS release

# Copy the remaining installed gems from the "builder" stage:
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/bundle /usr/local/bundle

# Copy the app code and compiled assets from the "builder" stage to the
# final destination at /srv/rails-google-cloud-identity-demo:
COPY --from=builder --chown=nobody:nogroup /workspaces/rails-google-cloud-identity-demo /srv/rails-google-cloud-identity-demo

# Set the container user to 'nobody':
USER nobody

# Set the RAILS and PORT default values:
